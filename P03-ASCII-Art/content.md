# Getting Started

We are going to take a few steps to make a few features:

1. Send a request to the ASCII API ('http://artii.herokuapp.com')
1. Get text input from the user
1. Get font choice from user
1. See all possible font choices

```bash
$ cd cli-games
$ touch asciiart.py
```

And now open in Atom.
